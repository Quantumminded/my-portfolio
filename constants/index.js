The platform features a fully-functional web application with robust user authentication and authorization capabilities. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Tailwind and Knex.js for database management, and a custom-built backend, we have created a seamless user experience. Additionally, we have integrated Stripe for secure and seamless payment processing, allowing users to both post requests for translation services or offer their own services to others."
